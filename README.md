# OTP-ONE-TIME-PAD-Cryptography

One Time Pad algorithm Cryptography application for Windows.

It request one text which we want to encrypt and a key which have same length as text to encrypt/decyrpt the text. 
And with their ASCII values, algorithm getting binary values of text and key and multiply this two values and creating encrypted text.

After that to decyrpt it, this time it multiply the key and encyrpited text and our decyrpted text reveals again.

Note that; to make this work properly, we are accepting that our text and key have same length. And also to make this application practicable, we are also accepting that sender and reciever both know the key.
